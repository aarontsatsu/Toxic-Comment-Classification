# Toxic-Comment-Classification
A machine learning project that uses dataset from Kaggle to train a model that classifies as comments under various toxicity metrics. The model does its prediction using the Logistic Regression Algorithm. Also, the project includes a web app built using the flask framework to visualize the model's use.

To use the app, run the app.py file to start the Flask app.
